  projection, dated and authored history for every change.
- First-launch Author setup; every entry is attributed to the device's Author.
- Clowders: create, rename, list; address and responsible person as ordinary
  Field values with history.
- Starter Field definitions seeded on first launch (gender, color, neutered,
  pregnant, birth date, deceased, address, responsible person).
- Cats: create inside a Clowder with name and photo, multiple photos per Cat,
  automatic compression on import (2560 px long edge), content-addressed image
  storage, Profile Image (defaults to the first photo, choosable), Clowder
  view as a grid of cat faces.
