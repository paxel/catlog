## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

Milestone M1: local-only catalog with Cards.

### Added

- Walking skeleton: Flutter app (Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, macOS) with a
  pure-Dart catalog core — append-only entry log over SQLite, latest-wins
  projection, dated and authored history for every change.
- First-launch Author setup; every entry is attributed to the device's Author.
- Clowders: create, rename, list; address and responsible person as ordinary
  Field values with history.
- Starter Field definitions seeded on first launch (gender, color, neutered,
  pregnant, birth date, deceased, address, responsible person).
- Cats: create inside a Clowder with name and photo, multiple photos per Cat,
  automatic compression on import (2560 px long edge), content-addressed image
  storage, Profile Image (defaults to the first photo, choosable), Clowder
  view as a grid of cat faces.
- Typed Field editing on Cats and Clowders (text, yes/no, date, number,
  choice) with backdating ("as of" date on every edit), full timeline per Cat
  and Clowder, and per-Field history via long-press.
- User-defined global Fields: create your own Field with name, type, scope
  (cats/clowders/both), and options for choice fields — usable immediately,
  no app update needed.
